**Recruitment Automation Project: Code Repository**

**NOTE**

The Python file included here is not intended to be run on its own. If you're going to use the project, I would ask you to use the repositories listed here: https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=507572&p=38823944#p38823944


**Instructions**

If, for some reason, you are forced to make use of the raw code (due to an error on your computer, an error in the code while interacting with your computer, or some other error), follow the instructions below to run the code. 

1) Open your favorite text editor, create a new file, and copy and paste the raw Python code into it. 
2) Save the file with the name "recruitment automation" or similar. Ensure that when you save the file that you include ".py" at the end to denote that it is a Python file. 
3) Open your Power Shell (on Windows), Terminal (on Linux or OSX). On Windows, you can do this by pressing Win +X and selecting "Windows PowerShell". On Linux, there are a variety of ways, but the most common is to open your terminal window from your "Applications" menu. On Mac, use the search icon in the upper-right hand corner or in Launchpad to find "Terminal" and open it. 
4) WINDOWS: Once you have opened your terminal, locate the directory that your file is in. For simplicity's sake, I highly suggest placing it in your "C:\\Users\username" folder. If you did not, you will need to locate the file on your computer's drive, copy the folder path, and type `cd "path"` into the terminal. Once you have done this, you can simply type the name of your text file (ie, "recruitment_automation.py") into the command line and it will run. 
4) LINUX: Once you open your terminal, type `python3 "recruitment_automation.py"` and the program will run in your terminal. 
4) MAC: (I dont use OSX. Blank until testing can be done. In the meantime, I suggest trying something similar to the Linux solution)
5) Enjoy your recruitment!
